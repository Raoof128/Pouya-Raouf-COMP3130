# Changelog

All notable changes to the MQ Navigation Flutter app.

## [Unreleased]

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Full web-to-Flutter navigation parity

**Scope:** Complete parity audit between the Next.js web map and Flutter map, then implement all missing navigation features.

**Summary:**
Audited the web map components (`GoogleMapController.tsx`, `GoogleMapCanvas.tsx`, `GoogleRoutePanel.tsx`, `CampusMap.tsx`) against the Flutter map feature. Identified 21 PASS items and 11 MISSING capabilities, then implemented all 11:

1. **Arrival detection** — haversine check (≤30 m to destination) triggers `hasArrived` state with celebration card UI
2. **Start/Stop navigation lifecycle** — separated `loadRoute()` (loads route without navigating) from `startNavigation()` (begins follow-user + arrival detection), matching the web's explicit two-step flow
3. **Follow-user camera** — both renderers track user location during active navigation
4. **Off-route detection** — flags when user is >50 m from last route-fetch point AND distance to destination exceeds route distance × 1.5
5. **Route recalculation** — auto re-fetches route when user moves >80 m from last fetch origin or goes off-route
6. **Open in Google Maps** — `url_launcher` deep-link to Google Maps directions with travel mode mapping
7. **Expandable step directions** — numbered, collapsible instruction list (was previously limited to first 3 steps)
8. **Travel mode persistence** — `SharedPreferences` stores selected travel mode across sessions
9. **Route bounds fitting** — Google renderer fits camera to route bounding box on first route load
10. **Walking dashed polyline** — Google renderer uses `PatternItem.dash(20)/gap(10)` for walking mode
11. **Walked-portion dimming** — both renderers split polyline at closest point to user, dimming the walked segment

**Files changed:**
- `pubspec.yaml` — added `shared_preferences: ^2.5.0`, `url_launcher: ^6.3.1`
- `lib/features/map/domain/services/geo_utils.dart` — new: haversine distance, closest-point finder
- `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart` — navigation state machine, arrival/off-route detection, travel mode persistence, Google Maps handoff
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/route_panel.dart` — complete rewrite: arrival card, next instruction, expandable steps, Start/Stop buttons, Google Maps button
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus_map_view.dart` — follow-user camera, walked-portion polyline split
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google_map_view.dart` — follow-user camera, dashed walking polyline, route bounds fitting, walked-portion split
- `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart` — wired all new props to RoutePanel and both map views
- `test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart` — updated for `loadRoute()` → `startNavigation()` two-step lifecycle

**Verification:**
- `dart format` — 0 issues (7 files formatted)
- `flutter analyze` — 0 issues
- `flutter test` — 101/101 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Street View/Pegman, user accuracy circle with animated dot, and origin-dot marker are web-only visual polish not yet ported
- Campus renderer walking-dashed-polyline parity requires `flutter_map` pattern support or a custom painter

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Blueprint gap audit fixes

**Scope:** Close the two remaining gaps from the full dual-map blueprint acceptance audit.

**Summary:**
A full 37-criterion audit against the implementation blueprint scored 35/37 PASS, 2 PARTIAL. This change closes both partials:

1. **Export automation** — Added `tools/sync_buildings.dart`, a standalone Dart CLI script that fetches the building registry from the Supabase `app_config` table and writes normalised JSON to `assets/data/buildings.json`. Reads credentials from `.env` or `--url`/`--key` flags. This provides a repeatable sync path from the Supabase source of truth to the bundled Flutter asset, removing the dependency on manual copy from the web repo export.

2. **Auth design documentation** — Added a doc comment on `MapsRoutesRemoteSource` explicitly documenting that unauthenticated route access is intentional: the app has no login requirement (AGENT.md), unauthenticated callers are rate-limited by IP (60 req/60 s), and the Bearer token path is already wired for future auth if needed.

**Files changed:**
- `tools/sync_buildings.dart` — new: Supabase → `buildings.json` sync script
- `lib/features/map/data/datasources/maps_routes_remote_source.dart` — added auth design-decision doc comment
- `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — appended Raouf log entries

**Verification:**
- `dart format tools/sync_buildings.dart lib/features/map/data/datasources/maps_routes_remote_source.dart` — 0 issues
- `flutter analyze` — 0 issues
- `flutter test` — 101/101 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Integrate `sync_buildings.dart` into CI/CD if automated Supabase → Flutter asset sync is desired.

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Align Google building targets with campus mode

**Scope:** Fix the Google renderer so building markers and camera focus use the same coordinate source and preserve the active map framing when switching renderers.

**Summary:**
The Google map was centering selected buildings with `routingLatitude` and `routingLongitude` but still rendering markers with the raw building-center `latitude` and `longitude`. For buildings that ship separate entrance coordinates, this made the Google renderer appear slightly offset compared with campus mode. The fix adds a shared geographic-target resolver, reuses it for both Google marker placement and selected-building camera focus, and applies an initial camera sync in `onMapCreated` so toggling from campus mode keeps the currently selected building or location in view instead of falling back to the default campus center.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/map_view_helpers.dart` — added a shared building geographic-target resolver
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google_map_view.dart` — unified marker/camera targeting and synced initial camera state
- `test/features/map/building_test.dart` — added regression coverage for entrance-vs-center target resolution
- `AGENT.md` — logged the change
- `CHANGELOG.md` — logged the change

**Verification:**
- `dart format lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/map_view_helpers.dart lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google_map_view.dart test/features/map/building_test.dart`
- `flutter test test/features/map/building_test.dart` (15/15 passed)
- `flutter analyze` (0 issues)
- `flutter test` (101/101 passed)

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Normalize campus overlay bounds for flutter_map

**Scope:** Fix the campus renderer crash caused by constructing `flutter_map` bounds from raw image-pixel dimensions.

**Summary:**
The campus map was still using raw overlay pixels like `3307` and `4678` as `LatLng` values when building `LatLngBounds`, which violates `flutter_map`’s latitude assertions even under `CrsSimple`. The fix introduces a normalized map-space coordinate layer in `CampusOverlayMeta` and routes all campus conversions through it. The raster overlay stays at full source resolution, but `CampusProjectionImpl` now converts pixel coordinates into a scaled coordinate system whose bounds remain inside valid `LatLng` limits, and `CampusMapView` builds overlay/camera bounds from those normalized values instead of raw pixels. Added regressions for both the large-asset normalization path and the exported shared overlay metadata.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/features/map/domain/entities/campus_overlay_meta.dart` — added normalized map-space helpers and scale computation
- `lib/features/map/data/mappers/campus_projection_impl.dart` — converted pixel/map transforms to use normalized bounds
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus_map_view.dart` — stopped building `LatLngBounds` from raw pixel values
- `test/features/map/campus_projection_test.dart` — added large-overlay normalization regression
- `test/features/map/building_registry_asset_test.dart` — asserted exported overlay metadata resolves to safe `flutter_map` bounds
- `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — appended Raouf log entries

**Verification:**
- `dart format lib/features/map/domain/entities/campus_overlay_meta.dart lib/features/map/data/mappers/campus_projection_impl.dart lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus_map_view.dart test/features/map/campus_projection_test.dart test/features/map/building_registry_asset_test.dart`
- `flutter test test/features/map/campus_projection_test.dart test/features/map/building_registry_asset_test.dart`
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Keep constructing campus bounds through the normalized helpers; raw overlay pixels should never be passed directly to `LatLngBounds`

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Harden top-level framework error fallback

**Scope:** Remove the last recursive error path in the app shell by making the framework fallback render safely without inherited app context.

**Summary:**
Fetched Flutter’s official error-handling guidance and aligned the app with it more strictly. The remaining runtime loop was not a live `setState` in `ErrorBoundary`; it was the fallback widget rethrowing because it depended on `Material`, `Theme.of`, and inherited `Directionality` before the app shell was fully available. `ErrorBoundary` remains a transparent wrapper, `FlutterError.onError` remains logging-only, and the fallback in `lib/core/error/error_boundary.dart` is now a context-free widget built only from low-level widgets and explicit styles so it can render even when `MaterialApp` has not established inherited state yet. Added a regression test that pumps the fallback directly with no `MaterialApp` to prove the fallback is self-sufficient and cannot recurse through `No Directionality widget found`.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/core/error/error_boundary.dart` — removed `Material`/`Theme` assumptions from the framework fallback and clarified the logging-only role of global error handlers
- `test/core/error_boundary_test.dart` — added direct no-`MaterialApp` fallback coverage
- `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — appended Raouf log entries

**Verification:**
- `dart format lib/core/error/error_boundary.dart lib/app/mq_navigation_app.dart test/core/error_boundary_test.dart`
- `flutter test test/core/error_boundary_test.dart`
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 98/98 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Use a full hot restart or stop/start run after changing bootstrap-level error hooks; Flutter hot reload does not rerun `main()`

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Remove ErrorBoundary framework hook entirely

**Scope:** Eliminate the remaining build-phase assertions by removing widget-level error interception from the app shell.

**Summary:**
The deferred `setState` fix was still too brittle because the root issue was architectural: Flutter does not support a React-style stateful error boundary that recovers from `FlutterError.onError`. `ErrorBoundary` is now a transparent wrapper with no framework hook logic, and render-time fallback UI is handled where Flutter expects it, via `ErrorWidget.builder` inside `installErrorHandlers()`. Global logging remains in `FlutterError.onError` and `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError`, but there is now no widget-level `setState` or `markNeedsBuild` path attached to framework error callbacks. This fully removes the `setState() or markNeedsBuild() called during build` and `owner!._debugCurrentBuildTarget != null` assertions tied to `ErrorBoundary`.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/core/error/error_boundary.dart` — converted `ErrorBoundary` into a transparent wrapper and moved fallback UI ownership to `ErrorWidget.builder`
- `test/core/error_boundary_test.dart` — updated regression coverage for the transparent wrapper and installed render fallback
- `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — appended Raouf fix log entries

**Verification:**
- `dart format lib/core/error/error_boundary.dart test/core/error_boundary_test.dart`
- `flutter test test/core/error_boundary_test.dart`
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 97/97 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- If feature-level recovery UX is needed later, build it above the risky subtree rather than intercepting `FlutterError.onError` inside a stateful widget

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Fix ErrorBoundary setState timing assertion

**Scope:** Prevent the app-level error boundary from mutating widget state inside Flutter’s synchronous framework error callback.

**Summary:**
Fixed the `owner!._debugCurrentBuildTarget != null` assertion triggered by `ErrorBoundary` calling `setState` directly from `FlutterError.onError`. The boundary now preserves the previously installed Flutter error handler, queues the most recent exception, and updates its fallback UI in a post-frame callback instead of synchronously during the framework error/reporting cycle. This keeps the fallback screen behavior, preserves existing global error reporting, and removes the illegal rebuild request that was crashing debug runs. Added a regression widget test that exercises the boundary handler and verifies the fallback appears only after the deferred frame.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/core/error/error_boundary.dart` — chained previous error handler and deferred fallback state updates out of `FlutterError.onError`
- `test/core/error_boundary_test.dart` — regression coverage for the deferred fallback behavior
- `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — appended Raouf fix log entries

**Verification:**
- `dart format lib/core/error/error_boundary.dart test/core/error_boundary_test.dart`
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test test/core/error_boundary_test.dart`
- `flutter test` → 96/96 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Reuse the same deferred error-state pattern if the app adds more feature-scoped error boundaries later

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Correct campus overlay parity math

**Scope:** Align the Flutter campus raster renderer with the web `CRS.Simple` overlay rules instead of the earlier mixed-offset fallback.

**Summary:**
Corrected the remaining campus-overlay parity drift. Flutter now consumes calibrated GPS projection coefficients from the shared web export, keeps the image bounds locked to the real raster dimensions, applies the web building X-offset only to stored building pin coordinates, and projects GPS-derived route/current-location points through the calibrated affine transform without that marker offset. The campus camera now fits the same pixel bounds with the same padding/max-zoom model as the web map, and campus marker anchoring was corrected so the coordinate lands on the intended visual point instead of the top edge of the marker widget. Added regression tests for the projection split and overlay metadata shape, and refreshed map docs to describe the calibrated export path.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/features/map/domain/entities/campus_overlay_meta.dart`, `lib/features/map/domain/services/campus_projection.dart`, `lib/features/map/data/mappers/campus_projection_impl.dart` — renderer-agnostic overlay metadata and split projection rules
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus_map_view.dart` — exact raster bounds, fit-bounds camera setup, corrected marker anchor, GPS-vs-building projection usage
- `assets/data/campus_overlay_meta.json` — regenerated shared overlay metadata with pixel bounds and affine calibration coefficients
- `test/features/map/campus_projection_test.dart`, `test/features/map/building_registry_asset_test.dart` — regression coverage for projection behavior and exported metadata
- `map_inventory.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TECHNICAL_EXPLANATION.md` — documentation alignment
- `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — appended Raouf parity-correction log entries

**Verification:**
- `node --experimental-strip-types tools/export_buildings.mjs` (from sibling web repo)
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 95/95 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Re-run the export bridge whenever the web team changes the GCP calibration set or campus overlay asset

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Complete dual-map parity backend/assets pass

**Scope:** Replace the remaining placeholder map pieces with shared exported assets, web-parity search behavior, and server-side routing.

**Summary:**
Completed the next substantial dual-map implementation step. Campus mode now reads the real exported raster image plus overlay metadata and renders in the same pixel coordinate space as the web app using `flutter_map` + `CrsSimple`. The bundled building registry was regenerated from the web source with `code`, `campusX/campusY`, and `searchTokens`, and Flutter search now follows the same ranking order as the web `buildingSearch.ts`. Route loading was migrated off the legacy client/Directions path onto the `maps-routes` Supabase Edge Function for both renderers, with a normalized response model that supports Google Routes data and campus-mode path points. The Edge Function was updated to accept anon clients safely, rate-limit by user or IP, dispatch Google mode to Google Routes, dispatch campus mode to OpenRouteService when configured, and fall back to a generated demo campus path when `ORS_API_KEY` is absent. Map docs and inventories were updated to reflect the new secure architecture.

**Files changed:**
- `assets/data/buildings.json`, `assets/data/campus_overlay_meta.json`, `assets/maps/mq-campus.png` — synced exported campus registry and raster overlay assets
- `lib/features/map/data/datasources/map_assets_source.dart`, `maps_routes_remote_source.dart`, `google_routes_remote_source.dart`, `campus_routes_remote_source.dart` — shared asset loading and secure route backend wiring
- `lib/features/map/data/mappers/campus_projection_impl.dart`, `lib/features/map/domain/entities/building.dart`, `campus_overlay_meta.dart`, `nav_instruction.dart`, `route_leg.dart`, `lib/features/map/domain/services/building_search.dart`, `campus_projection.dart` — web-parity map data contracts and search/routing normalization
- `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart`, `pages/map_page.dart`, `widgets/building_search_sheet.dart`, `widgets/campus_map_view.dart`, `widgets/google_map_view.dart`, `widgets/map_view_helpers.dart` — shared controller/search updates and raster campus renderer implementation
- `supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`, `supabase/config.toml` — anon-safe normalized route proxy for Google and campus routing
- `README.md`, `TECHNICAL_EXPLANATION.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `map_inventory.md`, `endpoint_inventory.md`, `env_inventory.md` — documentation/inventory alignment
- `test/features/map/building_search_test.dart`, `building_test.dart`, `map_route_test.dart`, `building_registry_asset_test.dart` — new regression coverage for the updated contracts

**Verification:**
- `node --experimental-strip-types tools/export_buildings.mjs` (from sibling web repo)
- `deno check supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 92/92 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Street View / Pegman parity still remains richer on the web Google Maps stack than in Flutter

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Ignore Codex workspace metadata

**Scope:** Keep the Flutter repo clean after local Codex runs.

**Summary:**
Added `.codex/` to the app-level `.gitignore` so local Codex desktop workspace metadata does not appear as an untracked repository change. This is cleanup only; it does not affect runtime behavior or build output.

**Files changed:**
- `.gitignore` — ignored `.codex/`
- `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — appended Raouf cleanup log entries

**Verification:**
- `git status --short` — `.codex/` no longer appears as an untracked path

**Follow-ups:**
- None

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Fix Chrome Google Maps teardown crash

**Scope:** Remove the web-only Google Maps dispose path that was crashing Chrome during renderer teardown.

**Summary:**
Fixed the Chrome assertion from `google_maps_flutter_web` (`"Maps cannot be retrieved before calling buildView!"`) that occurred when the Flutter widget disposed a `GoogleMapController` before the web platform view had fully completed its build lifecycle. `GoogleMapView` now performs explicit controller disposal on native platforms only, which preserves native cleanup while avoiding the broken web teardown path. Also re-checked the dependency graph with `flutter pub outdated`: all direct and dev dependencies in this repository are already current, and the repeated "newer versions incompatible with dependency constraints" message is coming from upstream-transitive packages outside this repo's direct constraints.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google_map_view.dart` — skipped explicit controller disposal on web and documented the platform-specific reason
- `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — appended Raouf fix log entries

**Verification:**
- `dart format lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google_map_view.dart`
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 86/86 passed
- `flutter pub outdated` → direct dependencies up to date; remaining notices are transitive only

**Follow-ups:**
- Revisit the web-specific dispose guard if a future `google_maps_flutter_web` release fixes controller teardown ordering

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Audit fix dual-renderer race and UI inconsistencies

**Scope:** Audit the new dual-renderer map implementation and fix correctness/state regressions.

**Summary:**
Performed a review pass on the dual-renderer foundation and fixed the highest-risk issue: stale async route responses could overwrite newer state if the user changed destination, renderer, or travel mode while a route request was still in flight. `MapController` now versions route requests and ignores outdated completions. Also aligned the search bottom sheet with controller state by seeding its text field from the active query, removed the stale unused `map_mode.dart` entity from the old state model, and adjusted map-shell top control spacing so the overlay controls are positioned relative to the page body instead of double-counting the device top safe area below the app bar.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart` — invalidated stale route requests and cleared obsolete loading state
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/building_search_sheet.dart` — seeded the search field from current controller query
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/map_shell.dart` — corrected top overlay spacing
- `lib/features/map/domain/entities/map_mode.dart` — deleted stale unused entity
- `test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart` — added stale-route regression coverage
- `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — appended Raouf audit log entries

**Verification:**
- `dart format lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/building_search_sheet.dart lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/map_shell.dart test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart`
- `flutter test test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart`
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 86/86 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Campus mode still needs the real raster overlay asset plus campus-space metadata to reach full web-parity overlay behaviour

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Build dual-renderer map foundation

**Scope:** Refactor the Flutter map feature toward the shared-shell, dual-renderer architecture from the web app.

**Summary:**
Implemented the first production-ready dual-renderer foundation for the map feature. The map now has one shared Riverpod controller state and two explicit renderer targets: a new `flutter_map`-based campus renderer foundation and a renamed `GoogleMapView` for Google rendering. Added `MapRendererType`, campus-coordinate support on the shared `Building` entity, a shared polyline decoder, a campus-route adapter source, and a reusable `MapShell` with renderer toggle plus left-side search/location controls. The page can now switch campus ↔ Google without losing selected building or route state. Documentation was updated to describe the new renderer split and to call out that routing still needs the planned server-backed campus engine and legacy Directions migration.

**Files changed:**
- `pubspec.yaml`, `pubspec.lock` — added `flutter_map`/`latlong2`, aligned `google_maps_flutter` with 2.15.0
- `lib/features/map/domain/entities/building.dart` — added optional campus coordinate parsing/serialization
- `lib/features/map/domain/entities/campus_point.dart`, `lib/features/map/domain/entities/map_renderer_type.dart` — added new map foundation entities
- `lib/features/map/domain/services/map_polyline_codec.dart` — shared polyline decoding for both renderers
- `lib/features/map/data/datasources/campus_routes_remote_source.dart` — phase-1 campus routing adapter
- `lib/features/map/data/datasources/google_routes_remote_source.dart`, `location_source.dart` — formatter-aligned existing map data sources after the repository contract update
- `lib/features/map/data/repositories/map_repository_impl.dart` — renderer-aware route dispatch
- `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart` — renderer state, navigation-state cleanup, shared route loading
- `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart` — moved to shared shell composition
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus_map_view.dart` — new `flutter_map` campus renderer foundation
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google_map_view.dart` — explicit Google renderer extracted from old campus widget
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/map_action_stack.dart`, `map_mode_toggle.dart`, `map_shell.dart`, `map_view_helpers.dart` — shared renderer UI/control helpers
- `lib/features/map/domain/entities/nav_instruction.dart`, `route_leg.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/route_panel.dart` — formatter-only normalization in adjacent map files
- `test/features/map/building_test.dart`, `test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart` — added campus-field and renderer-state coverage
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `map_inventory.md` — documented the new renderer split and remaining routing gap
- `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — appended Raouf implementation logs

**Verification:**
- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 85/85 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Replace the campus-route fallback with the planned server-backed campus engine
- Add the missing raster overlay asset plus campus-space metadata/bounds
- Migrate Google routing off the legacy client/Directions path and onto the server-only Routes flow

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Fix Chrome crash, map bounds, and Android Kotlin daemon

**Scope:** Fix multi-platform launch failures and map usability issues.

**Summary:**
Fixed three critical issues preventing the app from running:

1. **Chrome crash ("SUPABASE_URL must be set via --dart-define")** — Added hardcoded
   development-only fallback values to `env_config.dart` so a bare `flutter run -d chrome`
   works in debug mode without `--dart-define-from-file=.env`. The `validate()` method now
   only throws in release mode.

2. **Android Kotlin daemon failure** — The `kotlin.compiler.execution.strategy=in-process`
   property was already set but stale daemon processes and build caches caused connection
   failures. Fixed by cleaning the build, killing all Gradle/Kotlin daemons, and rebuilding.

3. **Map not panning outside campus** — Removed `CameraTargetBounds` and `MinMaxZoomPreference`
   restrictions from `CampusMapView` so users can freely pan and zoom beyond the campus
   boundaries when navigating to/from off-campus locations.

4. **Map marker clutter** — Changed non-selected building markers from orange (hueOrange) to
   a subtle azure (hueAzure) at 55% opacity, making them less visually intrusive and
   distinguishable from the selected marker (red, 100% opacity).

**Files changed:**
- `lib/core/config/env_config.dart` — hardcoded debug fallbacks, release-only validation
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus_map_view.dart` — removed bounds/zoom lock, improved markers
- `android/gradle.properties` — already had in-process strategy (no change needed)
- `.env.example` — simplified (removed DEV_ prefix vars)
- `map_inventory.md` — updated for Directions API, removed bounds section
- `env_inventory.md` — updated for hardcoded fallbacks, removed web-only section
- `endpoint_inventory.md` — updated routing approach
- `README.md` — simplified getting started, updated secrets table

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 83/83 passed
- `flutter build web --debug` → ✓
- `flutter build apk --debug` → ✓

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Add full technical explanation document

**Scope:** Write a repository-level technical explanation based on the implemented Flutter app, backend functions, platform setup, tooling, and tests.

**Summary:**
Added `TECHNICAL_EXPLANATION.md` as a dedicated technical walkthrough of the project. The document explains the startup flow, routing model, core infrastructure, design system, localization pipeline, feature modules (`home`, `settings`, `notifications`, `map`), Supabase Edge Functions, platform integration, CI/tooling, and test coverage. It also explicitly documents the current architectural mismatch where the Flutter map client still calls Google Directions directly while project docs describe the `maps-routes` Edge Function as the intended secure routing path.

**Files changed:**
- `TECHNICAL_EXPLANATION.md` — new full technical explanation document
- `AGENT.md` — appended Raouf log entry for this documentation update
- `CHANGELOG.md` — appended changelog entry for this documentation update

**Verification:**
- Read through the full repository structure and implementation before writing
- Cross-checked the document against current Dart, Supabase, platform, CI, and test files
- No application code changed

**Follow-ups:**
- Update the explanation when the map client is migrated to the `maps-routes` Edge Function
- Keep the document aligned with future feature-scope or architecture changes

---

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Polish technical explanation doc link

**Scope:** Correct a markdown path typo in the new technical explanation document.

**Summary:**
Fixed an internal path reference in `TECHNICAL_EXPLANATION.md` so the `mq_spacing.dart` link points to the correct file location.

**Files changed:**
- `TECHNICAL_EXPLANATION.md` — corrected markdown path
- `AGENT.md` — appended Raouf log entry for the polish edit
- `CHANGELOG.md` — appended changelog entry for the polish edit

**Verification:**
- Reviewed the corrected markdown target
- No application code changed

**Follow-ups:**
- None
### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Flutter upgrade + fix untranslated messages

**Scope:** Upgrade Flutter SDK and dependencies, fix 2 untranslated i18n keys across 34 locales.

**Summary:**
Upgraded Flutter from 3.41.2 to 3.41.4. Upgraded 4 major dependencies: flutter_local_notifications 18→21, connectivity_plus 6→7, geolocator 13→14, timezone 0.10→0.11. Fixed breaking API changes in flutter_local_notifications v21 (all methods switched from positional to named parameters, UILocalNotificationDateInterpretation removed). Added `studyPromptNotificationTitle` and `studyPromptNotificationBody` translations to all 34 non-English locale ARB files.

**Files changed:**
- `pubspec.yaml` — bumped 4 dependency versions
- `pubspec.lock` — regenerated with 13 dependency changes
- `lib/features/notifications/data/datasources/local_notifications_service.dart` — migrated initialize/show/zonedSchedule/cancel to named parameters, removed UILocalNotificationDateInterpretation
- `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 files) — added studyPromptNotificationTitle + studyPromptNotificationBody

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 83/83 passed
- `flutter gen-l10n` → 0 untranslated messages

**Follow-ups:**
- 5 transitive packages still have newer incompatible versions (analyzer, app_links, meta, win32, _fe_analyzer_shared) — blocked by upstream constraints

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Settings audit fix batch (10 issues)

**Scope:** Full UI/UX/data audit of settings feature — fix all findings.

**Summary:**
Fixed 10 issues across 4 files from a comprehensive settings audit. Critical: S1 — language picker "System" (null) selection broken after redesign; fixed with `_PickerItem<T>` wrapper to disambiguate null values from bottom-sheet dismissal. High: S2 — repository silently swallowed save errors (returned preferences instead of rethrowing); controller never detected failure, causing data loss on restart; fixed by rethrowing + controller revert-on-failure pattern. Medium: S3 — error state had no retry mechanism (added retry button with `ref.invalidate`); S4 — removed `dense: true` from bottom-sheet ListTile to meet 48dp tap target; S5 — Experience section used wrong l10n keys (`aboutDesc`/`emailNotificationsDesc` swapped for `campusMapDesc`/`studyPromptNotificationBody`); S6 — controller error message hardcoded but controller now reverts state instead of going to AsyncError. Low: S7 — added `==`/`hashCode` to UserPreferences for value equality; S8 — made toggle row fully tappable (InkWell wrapping entire row); S9 — version still hardcoded (acceptable for v1.0); S10 — added Semantics wrappers to `_InfoRow` and `_AboutAppRow`.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart` — S1 (PickerItem wrapper), S3 (retry button), S4 (dense removed), S5 (l10n keys), S8 (InkWell on toggle), S10 (Semantics), toggle error snackbar
- `lib/features/settings/presentation/controllers/settings_controller.dart` — S6 (revert state on failure instead of AsyncError)
- `lib/features/settings/data/repositories/settings_repository.dart` — S2 (rethrow on save failure)
- `lib/shared/models/user_preferences.dart` — S7 (== and hashCode)

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 83/83 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- S9: Wire `package_info_plus` for dynamic version display (low priority, acceptable for v1.0)

### Raouf: 2026-03-12 (AEDT) — Settings page redesign (HTML reference)

**Scope:** Redesign settings page to match the provided HTML/CSS reference design.

**Summary:**
Complete visual overhaul of the settings page to match the dark-themed HTML reference design. Replaced generic Material ListTile/Card widgets with custom components faithful to the reference aesthetic: dark charcoal surfaces, red glow radial gradient, uppercase red section headers with letter-spacing, rounded cards with subtle white/5 borders, bottom-sheet pickers (replacing inline DropdownButton), vivid red toggle switches, and a branded about-app row with red shadow glow. Both light and dark mode fully supported. RTL-compatible with EdgeInsetsDirectional.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart` — complete rewrite with custom widgets (_SectionHeader, _SettingsCard, _TapRow, _ToggleRow, _InfoRow, _AboutAppRow), bottom-sheet pickers, red glow gradient background
- `lib/app/theme/mq_colors.dart` — added vividRed (#FF0025), charcoal950 (#12080A), charcoal850 (#1C0D0F)

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 83/83 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- None — visual polish; no logic changes needed.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Fix zone mismatch in bootstrap

**Scope:** Move `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` inside `runZonedGuarded` so it shares the same zone as `runApp()`.

**Summary:**
`ensureInitialized()` was called in the root zone while `runApp()` was called inside `runZonedGuarded()`. Flutter requires both in the same zone. Moved binding initialization inside the guarded zone.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/app/bootstrap/bootstrap.dart`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 88/88 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- None

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Fix dart:io Platform crash on web

**Scope:** Replace all `dart:io` `Platform.*` calls with web-safe alternatives.

**Summary:**
Four files used `dart:io`'s `Platform.isAndroid` / `Platform.isIOS` which throws `Unsupported operation: Platform._operatingSystem` when running on web (Chrome). Replaced all occurrences with `kIsWeb` guard + `defaultTargetPlatform` from `package:flutter/foundation.dart`. No `dart:io` imports remain anywhere in `lib/`.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/app/bootstrap/bootstrap.dart` — Firebase init guard
- `lib/features/notifications/data/datasources/fcm_service.dart` — `_isSupported` and platform-specific permission/token logic
- `lib/features/notifications/data/datasources/local_notifications_service.dart` — `_isSupported`
- `lib/features/map/data/datasources/location_source.dart` — `_isSupported`

**Follow-ups:**
- None

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Fix Scripts + ARB + Run Configuration

**Scope:** Fix run.sh, add missing .env.example, propagate 13 missing ARB keys to all 34 locales.

**Summary:**
Rewrote `scripts/run.sh` to use Flutter's built-in `--dart-define-from-file` flag instead of manually parsing `.env` with shell IFS splitting. Created `.env.example` with placeholder keys so fresh clones have a setup template (the `.gitignore` already preserves it via `!.env.example`). Added 13 missing localization keys to all 34 non-English ARB files — these were added to `app_en.arb` during Phase 4/5 but never propagated, causing untranslated-message warnings on every build.

**Files changed:**
- `scripts/run.sh` — rewritten to use `--dart-define-from-file`
- `.env.example` — created with placeholder keys
- 34 ARB locale files — added `examReminders`, `systemAlerts`, `locationServicesDisabled`, `locationPermissionBlocked`, `locationPermissionRequired`, `locationUnsupported`, `locationUnavailable`, `dailyAt`, `deadlineLabel`, `studyPromptLabel`, `starts`, `ends`, `itemNoLongerAvailable`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed
- `flutter gen-l10n` → 0 untranslated warnings
- `scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed

**Follow-ups:**

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Documentation Sweep: Stale References Cleanup

**Scope:** Read all project `.md` docs and fix stale directory names, outdated test counts, and completed-status labels.

**Summary:**
Updated `README.md` to use `mq_navigation` directory name (was `mq-navigation_flutter`) and corrected the CI test count from 78 to 99. Updated `Flutter_Migration_Plan.md` to use `mq_navigation` directory name in the description, clone instructions, and repo links. Updated `endpoint_inventory.md` section header from "Edge Functions to Build" to "Edge Functions (Deployed)" since all 9 functions are implemented.

**Files changed:**
- `README.md` — directory path in clone instructions, test count in CI/CD section
- `Flutter_Migration_Plan.md` — description, clone instructions, repo link
- `endpoint_inventory.md` — section header

**Verification:**
- All 16 project docs reviewed — no remaining stale references in active content
- Historical AGENT.md/CHANGELOG.md entries preserved as-is

**Follow-ups:**
- None

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Plan Alignment Audit + Final Old-Name Cleanup

**Scope:** Verify full project alignment with the updated Flutter Migration Plan and eliminate the last old-name reference.

**Summary:**
Audited the entire codebase against the user's updated migration plan. Confirmed all navigation-focused goals (interactive map, building registry, directions, category filtering) are fully implemented and the project exceeds the plan's scope with completed auth, calendar, dashboard, notifications, and feed features. Fixed the critical Android Kotlin directory mismatch: `MainActivity.kt` was still at `io/syllabussync/syllabus_sync/` with the old package declaration while `build.gradle.kts` used `io.mqnavigation.mq_navigation` — moved to the correct directory path and updated the package declaration. Updated `Flutter_Migration_Plan.md` to remove stale external `syllabus-sync` URLs. Verified zero old-name references remain in source/config files.

**Files changed:**
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/io/mqnavigation/mq_navigation/MainActivity.kt` — created at correct path with `package io.mqnavigation.mq_navigation`
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/io/syllabussync/` — deleted (old directory tree)
- `Flutter_Migration_Plan.md` — removed stale syllabus-sync external URLs

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed
- Zero remaining old-name references in source/config files (historical changelog entries preserved)

**Follow-ups:**
- None — naming is fully consistent across the entire codebase

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Full Project Rename: Syllabus Sync → MQ Navigation

**Scope:** Rename every reference across the entire codebase from "Syllabus Sync" to "MQ Navigation".

**Summary:**
Renamed all name variants across the full project: Dart package name (`syllabus_sync` → `mq_navigation`), main app class (`SyllabusSyncApp` → `MqNavigationApp`), Android/iOS bundle identifiers (`io.syllabussync.*` → `io.mqnavigation.*`), URL schemes (`io.syllabussync://` → `io.mqnavigation://`), display name in all 35 ARB locale files, UI hardcoded strings, Edge Function email subjects, documentation, and platform config files. Renamed the main app file from `syllabus_sync_app.dart` to `mq_navigation_app.dart`. Regenerated Flutter l10n. Preserved external URLs pointing to the web app's GitHub repo and Vercel deployment. Renamed the project folder from `syllabus-sync_flutter` to `mq_navigation`.

**Files changed:**
- 300+ files across all categories:
  - All Dart source and test files (`package:syllabus_sync/` → `package:mq_navigation/`)
  - `lib/app/syllabus_sync_app.dart` → `lib/app/mq_navigation_app.dart` (file rename)
  - `pubspec.yaml` — package name
  - `android/app/build.gradle.kts` — namespace + applicationId
  - `android/fastlane/Appfile` — package name
  - `ios/Runner/Info.plist` — bundle name, URL scheme, usage descriptions
  - `ios/fastlane/Appfile` — app identifier
  - `supabase/config.toml` — project ID, redirect URIs
  - `supabase/functions/auth-email/index.ts` — email subject lines
  - 35 ARB locale files — display name references
  - All `.md` documentation files
  - Platform configs: `CMakeLists.txt`, `manifest.json`, `index.html`, `.xcscheme`, `.pbxproj`, `.xcconfig`, `Runner.rc`, `.cc`, `.cpp`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed
- Zero remaining old-name references in source/config files (only external web app URLs preserved)

**Follow-ups:**
- Commit and push
- If the sibling web app folder is also renamed, update `tools/convert_i18n.dart` path

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Updated Migration Plan Document

**Scope:** Create a comprehensive Flutter Migration Plan document reflecting the actual completed state of all phases 0–5.

**Summary:**
Built a full migration plan document (`Flutter_Migration_Plan.md`) aligned with the user's provided template format. The document covers the current state of both the web and mobile apps, the two-frontends-one-backend architecture, the complete tech stack with pinned dependencies, full project structure with feature-first clean architecture, navigation and route maps with cascading auth guards, detailed feature breakdown with Pouya/Raouf ownership across all 5 implementation phases, the 9-function Edge Functions inventory, i18n details (35 ARB locales with RTL support), the security model, environment configuration for both client and server, CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions + Fastlane), testing summary (99 tests across 15 files), team contributions, external deployment prerequisites, and how-to-run instructions.

**Files created:**
- `Flutter_Migration_Plan.md`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Commit and push the migration plan document

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Final Stage Verification + Release Handoff

**Scope:** Close verification for the last Phase 4/5 patch and document what remains outside the repo.

**Summary:**
Verified the completed Phase 4/5 implementation after the final native Firebase, localization, and typed map-error patch. Android now builds cleanly with conditional Google Services activation, iOS safely configures Firebase only when the service plist exists, notification/detail UI strings resolve through ARB-backed localization, and the map page now routes failures through typed `MapStateError` values instead of English sentinel strings. The only remaining gaps are external deployment prerequisites: real `android/app/google-services.json`, real `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`, APNs/FCM console setup, Google Cloud key restrictions, Supabase Edge Function secrets, and deployment of `notify` / `maps-routes`.

**Files changed:**
- `AGENT.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` → no issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed
- `./scripts/check.sh` → 6/6 checks passed, including debug APK build
- `deno check supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts` → passed
- `deno check supabase/functions/notify/index.ts` → passed
- `deno check supabase/functions/cleanup-cron/index.ts` → passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Commit and push the completed Phase 4/5 repo state to `origin/main`
- Apply Firebase, Supabase, and Google Cloud secrets/configuration in the target environments

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 4 + Phase 5 Runtime Stabilization

**Scope:** Resolve the first client runtime gaps found after the initial feed/notifications/map implementation pass.

**Summary:**
Normalized notification preferences so partially populated `notification_preferences` rows no longer break toggle updates, hardened notification/map JSON parsing and route-coordinate validation, and fixed feed pagination ordering so cursor-based pagination remains stable instead of reordering featured items ahead of the cursor. Added concrete `/detail/deadline/:deadlineId`, `/detail/exam/:examId`, and `/detail/event/:eventId` routes plus repository-backed academic item detail pages so notification deep links now land on real Flutter screens rather than unresolved paths. Also removed the last map analyze warning and replaced a small set of hardcoded map action labels with existing localized strings.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/features/notifications/domain/entities/notification_preferences.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/data/datasources/notification_remote_source.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/domain/entities/app_notification.dart`
- `lib/features/feed/data/repositories/feed_repository.dart`
- `lib/features/map/domain/entities/building.dart`
- `lib/features/map/data/datasources/google_routes_remote_source.dart`
- `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus_map_view.dart`
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/route_panel.dart`
- `lib/features/calendar/data/repositories/calendar_repository.dart`
- `lib/features/calendar/presentation/pages/academic_item_detail_page.dart`
- `lib/app/router/app_router.dart`

**Verification:**
- Pending final analyze/test pass after the server functions, docs, and tests are added in this same implementation cycle.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 4 + Phase 5 Edge Functions

**Scope:** Add the Supabase server-side implementation required by the new Flutter notification and map flows.

**Summary:**
Added a dedicated `maps-routes` Edge Function for the Flutter map stack with authenticated Google Routes proxying, strict request validation, and per-user `rate_limits` throttling at 60 requests per minute. Added a new `notify` Edge Function that validates the caller, writes the inbox record to `notifications`, dispatches push notifications through Firebase using server-side credentials, and removes stale `user_fcm_tokens` on push failures. Also corrected the existing cleanup cron so rate-limit cleanup now targets the documented `reset_time_ms` column instead of the stale `window_end` name, and registered both new functions in `supabase/config.toml`.

**Files changed:**
- `supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/notify/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/cleanup-cron/index.ts`
- `supabase/config.toml`

**Verification:**
- Pending final repo-wide verification after the Phase 4/5 tests and documentation updates are completed.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Edge Function TypeScript Cleanup

**Scope:** Correct the first-pass TypeScript issues in the new `notify` function before verification.

**Summary:**
Replaced invalid Dart-style array helpers in `supabase/functions/notify/index.ts` with standard TypeScript collection methods, made FCM v1 response parsing tolerant of non-JSON upstream error bodies, and tightened the remaining equality check so the new push dispatcher can be formatted and validated cleanly.

**Files changed:**
- `supabase/functions/notify/index.ts`

**Verification:**
- Pending function formatting and the final repo-wide verification pass.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 5 Registry + Regression Tests

**Scope:** Replace the temporary map asset with the audited web registry and add regression coverage for the new Phase 4/5 behavior.

**Summary:**
Regenerated `assets/data/buildings.json` from the sibling web app's `features/map/lib/buildings.ts` source so Flutter now bundles the full 153-building campus registry instead of a temporary sample list. The generated asset preserves the six audited `entranceLocation` and `googlePlaceId` enrichments and fills missing marker coordinates from the calibrated pixel map data so the MVP map can render the whole campus. Added targeted tests for notification preference normalization and stable reminder scheduling, feed-import event persistence through `source_public_event_id`, map route parsing, `/notifications` route constants, and an asset-level guard that fails if the bundled building registry drops below full campus scale.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 4 + Phase 5 Documentation Alignment

**Scope:** Bring the repository documentation and inventories in line with the implemented notifications, feed, and map stack.

**Summary:**
Updated the README with the delivered Phase 4/5 scope, the required mobile Firebase/Maps setup steps, and the Edge Function secret inventory for `notify` and `maps-routes`. Expanded `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with concrete subsystem notes for notifications/feed/map, corrected `env_inventory.md` to match the removed client-side Maps key fallback and the preferred Firebase service-account secret, and refreshed the endpoint, notification, map, and route inventories so they describe the implemented `/notifications`, `/detail/...`, `notify`, and `maps-routes` flows rather than the older placeholders. Also updated the stale `EnvConfig` test that still expected a committed debug Google Maps key fallback.

**Files changed:**
- `README.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `env_inventory.md`
- `endpoint_inventory.md`
- `notification_matrix.md`
- `map_inventory.md`
- `route_matrix.md`
- `test/core/env_config_test.dart`

**Verification:**
- Pending the final analyze/test/check pass.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 4 + Phase 5 Final Verification

**Scope:** Close the implementation cycle with repo-wide validation.

**Summary:**
Verified the completed Phase 4/5 pass end-to-end. `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` returned 0 issues, `flutter test` passed 99/99 tests including the new notification/map regressions and building-registry asset guard, `scripts/check.sh --quick` passed all 5 checks, and `deno check` succeeded for `supabase/functions/maps-routes`, `supabase/functions/notify`, and `supabase/functions/cleanup-cron`.

**Files changed:**
- `AGENT.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

**Verification:**
- Complete.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Final Stage Gap Closure

**Scope:** Finish the remaining concrete Phase 4/5 implementation gaps before commit.

**Summary:**
Added the missing native Firebase activation hooks so Android now auto-applies the Google Services plugin when `android/app/google-services.json` exists and iOS now configures Firebase automatically when `GoogleService-Info.plist` is present. Replaced the remaining hardcoded notification/detail strings with ARB-backed localization usage, and replaced map error sentinel strings with a typed `MapStateError` flow so the map UI no longer relies on English string comparisons for routing or location failures.

**Files changed:**
- `android/settings.gradle.kts`
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`
- `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`

**Verification:**
- Pending final analyze/test/build pass for this closing patch.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 4 + Phase 5 Implementation

**Scope:** Notifications foundation, feed implementation, map MVP implementation, mobile notification/bootstrap wiring, and native map SDK setup for the Phase 4/5 implementation pass.

**Summary:**
Added the first production notification slice: Firebase bootstrap registration, Android/iOS mobile notification permission hooks, local notification channels and scheduling services, Supabase-backed notification inbox/preferences data sources, a Riverpod notifications controller, and the `/notifications` route/page. Also resolved the first integration issues found by `flutter analyze` (`FirebaseMessaging` bootstrap import, the required `uiLocalNotificationDateInterpretation` scheduling parameter, and the feed query `DateTimeRange` import), replaced the placeholder feed screen with a Supabase-backed events/announcements feed plus filter/search/pagination and calendar-import wiring, replaced the placeholder map screen with a repository/controller/widget stack covering building registry loading, building search, location permission handling, Google Maps rendering, routing, and `/map/building/:id` deep links, and removed the committed Dart Google Maps dev key so the implementation depends on explicit client build configuration rather than a source-controlled key.

**Files changed:**
- `pubspec.yaml`
- `lib/core/config/env_config.dart`
- `lib/app/bootstrap/bootstrap.dart`
- `lib/app/mq_navigation_app.dart`

**Follow-ups:**
- Add the `notify` and `maps-routes` Supabase Edge Functions
- Document the required native Firebase service files and APNs setup
- Run `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, and `scripts/check.sh --quick`

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 0 Gap Closure: Edge Functions + Fastlane

**Scope:** Close the two remaining Phase 0 blueprint gaps — Supabase Edge Functions scaffold and Fastlane distribution config — identified during a full Phases 0–3 audit.

**Summary:**
Created the complete Supabase Edge Functions scaffold with 7 production-ready Deno functions matching the endpoint inventory: `auth-email` (Resend-based email verification send/resend/verify), `auth-cleanup` (expired password-reset and email-verification token cleanup), `routes-proxy` (Google Routes API proxy keeping billing key server-side), `places-proxy` (Google Places API search and detail proxy), `weather-proxy` (Google Weather API proxy for campus conditions), `security-utils` (Have I Been Pwned k-anonymity password breach check), and `cleanup-cron` (rate-limit and audit-log retention cleanup). All functions include shared CORS headers, structured error handling, and cron-secret verification where applicable.

Created Fastlane configs for both platforms: Android lanes (`build_debug`, `build_release`, `deploy_internal`, `promote_beta`) and iOS lanes (`build_debug`, `build_release`, `deploy_testflight`, `promote_appstore`), both with `--dart-define` environment variable injection for Supabase and Google Maps keys.

**Files created:**
- `supabase/config.toml` — Supabase project config with auth, redirect URLs, and per-function JWT settings
- `supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts` — Shared CORS headers and OPTIONS handler
- `supabase/functions/auth-email/index.ts` — Email verification via Resend API

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Remove Unrelated MQ_Navigation Tree

**Scope:** Clean the parent repository so `mq-navigation_flutter` remains the sole active Flutter application after the earlier history merge.

**Summary:**
Removed the unrelated `MQ_Navigation` directory from the repository root and restored the root documentation to point back to `mq-navigation_flutter` as the primary mobile app. No application logic inside `mq-navigation_flutter` was changed in this cleanup.

**Files changed:**
- Parent repo `README.md` — restored project paths to `mq-navigation_flutter`
- Parent repo git tree — removed `MQ_Navigation/**`

**Verification:**
- Root repository tree confirms `mq-navigation_flutter` is the only remaining Flutter app directory

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Context7 Audit Hardening for Phase 2 + Phase 3

**Scope:** Re-audit the completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 migration slices against current Flutter, go_router, and Supabase docs fetched via Context7, then correct any concrete deviations.

**Summary:**
Confirmed that the project’s core 2026 patterns are still correct: `MaterialApp.router`, `ErrorWidget.builder`, async `go_router` redirects, `refreshListenable`, and Supabase `onAuthStateChange` usage match current guidance. Tightened the implementation in the places where the audit found real runtime risks.

Auth routing now handles upstream Supabase failures safely by logging and falling back instead of throwing from the router redirect. Email verification refresh now guards the no-session state so the action does not fail before the verification deep link completes. Google OAuth sign-in now reports browser-launch failures instead of silently acting like the flow started. Biometric unlock now recovers when biometric support disappears after the preference was enabled by bypassing the lock for the session and turning the setting off. Calendar timeline state also now excludes undated or out-of-range to-dos and events from agenda/day/week views, and anonymous users now leave `/splash` for `/login` once auth loading completes.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/app/router/app_router.dart` — wrapped async MFA/profile guard reads with safe error handling
- `lib/app/router/route_guard.dart` — corrected post-loading anonymous redirect behavior from splash
- `lib/features/auth/data/repositories/auth_repository.dart` — surfaced Google OAuth launch failure as an app exception
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/controllers/auth_flow_controller.dart` — returned app exception messages to the UI
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/verify_email_page.dart` — guarded verification refresh when no session exists yet
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/biometric_lock_gate.dart` — handled unsupported biometrics without leaving the app stuck behind the lock overlay
- `lib/features/calendar/presentation/controllers/calendar_controller.dart` — constrained timeline entries to the focused week
- `lib/shared/models/academic_models.dart` — excluded undated to-dos from `CalendarEntry` timelines
- `test/app/route_guard_test.dart` — added anonymous splash redirect coverage
- `test/features/auth/auth_flow_controller_test.dart` — added Google OAuth launch failure coverage
- `test/features/calendar/calendar_state_test.dart` — added undated/out-of-range to-do timeline coverage

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → No issues found
- `flutter test` → 94/94 tests passed
- `scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 checks passed (All checks passed!)

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 2 + Phase 3 Delivery

**Scope:** Implement the migration blueprint’s mobile auth/profile/settings stack and home/calendar core inside the Flutter client.

**Summary:**
Replaced the placeholder Phase 2 experience with production-backed routes and screens for login, signup, email verification, password reset, MFA challenge/enrollment, onboarding, profile editing, and settings management. Added Supabase-backed repositories and Riverpod controllers for auth, profile, user preferences, and MFA state. Wired app-level theme, locale, and biometric lock behavior into `MaterialApp.router` and routing guards.

Replaced the placeholder Phase 3 experience with a repository-backed dashboard and calendar. Added shared academic models for units, deadlines, events, todos, gamification, dashboard stress metrics, and calendar entries.

### Raouf: 2026-03-10 (AEDT) — Context7 Docs Compliance Fixes

**Scope:** Compare codebase against latest 2026 Flutter/Riverpod/GoRouter/Supabase/local_auth docs via Context7; fix deviations.

**Summary:**
Fetched latest documentation for Flutter, Riverpod 3, GoRouter 17, Supabase Flutter, and local_auth 3 via Context7 MCP. Compared all patterns against our code. Found 3 deviations from the Flutter error handling docs: missing `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` (Layer 2 error catcher), missing `ErrorWidget.builder` customisation in MaterialApp, and missing `FlutterError.presentError` call for debug console output. All other patterns (ColorScheme.fromSeed, NavigationBar, AsyncNotifier, ref.listen/read/watch, refreshListenable, StatefulShellRoute, PKCE auth, onAuthStateChange, biometric API) confirmed correct.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/core/error/error_boundary.dart` — Added `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` (Layer 2) + `FlutterError.presentError` call
- `lib/app/mq_navigation_app.dart` — Added `MaterialApp.builder` with custom `ErrorWidget.builder`

**Verification:**
